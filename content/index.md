Having a place to write about my thought process while learning things like software development and video game design will be incredibly useful for me. I can organize lessons I've learned and I hope others can benefit from it as well. There's going to be a variety of posts that I'll be making here.

## [Game Development](game-development)

Blog entries related to solo video game development.

## [Miscellaneous Attachments](misc-attachments)

Various entries that are mostly just attachments for other blog entries.
