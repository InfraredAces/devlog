I think having a place to write about my thought process while learning things like software development and video game design will be incredibly useful for me. I can organize lessons I've learned and I hope others can benefit from it as well.

The prime motivator for creating this is that I've decided to make a game for the first time and I figured that having a development log would be useful. Chronicling my journey from a novice programmer to hopefully a solo game developer with at least one completed game.
